This is the default value.\n- `FixedPeriod`: The charge ends after a specified period based on the trigger date of the charge. If you set this field to `FixedPeriod`, you must specify the length of the period and a period type by defining the `UpToPeriods` and `UpToPeriodsType` fields.\n- `SpecificEndDate`: The specific date on which the charge ends. If you set this field to `SpecificEndDate`, you must specify the specific date by defining the `SpecificEndDate` field.\n\n\n\n**Note**: If the subscription ends before the charge end date, the charge ends when the subscription ends. But if the subscription end date is subsequently changed through a Renewal, or Terms and Conditions amendment, the charge will end on the charge end date. ",
